## vim.simple

> Simple and lean demonstrations for use with vim.

This repository is aimed at the mindset of a Vim user who realizes that Vim is powerful, but may be wavering. For example, there are some who may use Vim only as a toy, or as a second-best option to another editor or IDE.

Vim has some quirks, but once the true power of the editor starts to shine, and the user has overcome the most significant hurdle(s) there is *nothing* text-editor-related or IDE-related that cannot be done in Vim.

### The most significant hurdle to productivity with Vim

Realizing the power of *operators and motions* is the single most important realization for recognizing the true flexibility and agility of the Vim editor. It is possible to get things done without this realization, but it will not be pleasant. Once this realization sinks in, the learning curve associated with Vim decreases significantly.

### Baseline comparison

Because Vim varies significantly from standard desktop-style text editors, (but most people are familiar with those types of editors) this repository assumes familiarity with the desktop-style editors as a baseline of comparison.
