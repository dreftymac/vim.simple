## vim.simple

Simple and lean addons for use with vim.

### Overview

This project was started as a simple solution for cases where a user wishes to test sample configurations in Vim without necessarily adding them to her vimrc.

### Purpose

This project is intended to host very minimal one-off tests for inclusion into a pre-existing .vimrc configuration file. The goal is to provide a context where a vim user can "try before you buy".

### TODO

- [ ] segment configuration into 'islands' that the user can pick and choose for inclusion into vim.
- [ ] pull out configuration settings from old vimrc and organize into vim.simple
- [ ] dynamic yaml fitb generation mode
